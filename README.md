## Nordic MathML guidelines: Use, validation and feedback

We now have clear, detailed, and shared guidelines for MathML markup. To keep using a common set of guidelines going forward, we should establish shared procedures for how we validate, give feedback to the Indian suppliers and report issues.

### Use and maintenance of the MathML guidelines

- When you start using the new guidelines, you need to be very specific when ordering books from the Indian suppliers.
- If you discover problems with the guidelines or things that need to be changed, create an issue on GitHub, and tag @MartheGjelstad in the issue. Marthe is responsible for monitoring the issues and scheduling meetings when necessary. In this way, we can continue to have shared guidelines.

### Kvalidator: Validation of MathML

- To check if the mathematics is marked up correctly, we use the Kvalidator, and so will the Indian suppliers do.  
- Kvile is responsible for updating and maintaining the Kvalidator.
- If rules need to be added, or some rules are not working correctly, feedback should be sent to Kvile, with the rest of the MathML team in copy, to keep each other updated.

### Feedback to the Indian suppliers

- As the Indian suppliers have expressed, it will take some time for them to adjust to the new MathML guidelines. Therefore, now in the beginning, there will probably be some errors in the MathML markup. **We should always give feedback when we find mistakes.**
- Now, at the start of using the new MathML guidelines, we should correct minor errors ourselves. However, if a book contains consistent, fundamental errors in the MathML markup, like the use of `<semantics>`, the book should/can be returned.
